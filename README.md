## About project

Fillit is a project that let you discover and/or familiarize yourself with a recurring
problematic in programming: searching the optimal solution among a huge set of possibilities, in a respectable timing. In this particular project, you will have to find a way to
assemble a given Tetriminos set altogether in the smallest possible square.
A Tetriminos is a 4-blocks geometric figure you probably already heard of, thanks to
the popular game Tetris.

Program will take a file as parameter, which contains a list of Tetriminos, and arrange them
in order to create the smallest square possible.
Main goal is to find the smallest square in the minimal amount of time,
despite an exponentially growing number of possibilities each time a piece is added.

## About our team

Fillit was a project for two people. My teammate is a teacher of Maths, so we used some mathematics in the project. Our Fillit works on bits, and we didn't use school library. I made reading amd validation, my teammate - algos.

## How it works

1. Write "make" in command line, few seconds later builds a program.
2. All tests are in dir "tests"

Or you can run ./tests.sh , but you need valgrind to be installed on your PC
